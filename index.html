        <h1>Top 5 best movies of all time</h1>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for the 5 best movies of all time, you’re in the
          right place. For nearly 100 years, the art of cinema has been
          evolving, telling wild stories that capture the heart and the
          imagination – and the team at Empire, the world’s biggest and
          best-loved film magazine, is here to guide you through the cream of
          the crop. There are all kinds of reasons why certain movies stand the
          test of time – the very films conjure indelible images, evoke
          overwhelming emotions, tell unforgettable stories, and bring us
          characters who — love them or loathe them — we truly believe in.
          Whether seen on the big screen, a trusty TV, or whatever screen you
          can get your hands on, the greatest films still hit like nothing else.
          From the misadventures of Peruvian bears to the epic quests of
          almighty fellowships, whisper-quiet period romances to explosive comic
          book blockbusters, and awe-inspiring animated adventures to stories
          from all corners of the globe, there’s something out there for every
          taste.

        <h1>1) Jaws(1975)</h1>

        <h3><b>Director:</b> <u>Steven Spielberg</u></h3>
        <h3>
          <b>Starring:</b> <u>Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The impact of Jaws simply cannot be overstated. It created the notion
          of the summer blockbuster. It made millions feel it wasn’t safe to go
          back in the water. And, for all the clear potential of his early work,
          it well and truly put Spielberg on the map. It was, famously,
          nightmarish to shoot — waterlogged, behind schedule, over budget, and
          with a mechanical shark that kept breaking. But for all that churn
          beneath the surface, what the audience sees is effortless brilliance —
          a tense, beautifully-shot shark-attack thriller with deeply-layered
          characters, outstanding dialogue, and heart-stopping moments forever
          burned in the cultural landscape. The performances are all
          outstanding, but the real star here is Spielberg himself, delivering a
          pure display of movie mastery from first minute to last — the head,
          the tail, the whole damn thing.

        <h3><b>Director:</b> <u>Francis Ford Coppola</u></h3>
        <h3>
          <b>Starring:</b>
          <u>Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Stanley Kubrick once described Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of
          Mario Puzo's novel as the best film ever made – though having
          previously topped this list, this time it falls to bronze position. At
          once an arthouse drama and a commercial blockbuster, The Godfather
          marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. An icon of the gangster
          genre, it’s imprinted in popular culture – "Luca Brasi sleeps with the
          fishes", the horse's head in the bed – but the first instalment of
          Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch's fight for power is so much more
          than those moments. With performances, style and substance to savour,
          it managed to both smash box office records and live on as a staple of
          cinematic canon.

        <h3><b>Director:</b> <u>Frank Darabont</u></h3>
        <h3>
          <b>Starring:</b>
          <u>Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, William Sadler</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          It’s hard to fathom that Shawshank was largely ignored on release. And
          yet, it’s blindingly obvious why it became a word-of-mouth all-timer
          when released on VHS – it’s a soulful, smart adaptation of Stephen
          King on non-horror form. Frank Darabont doesn’t shy away from the
          harshness of prison life, as Tim Robbins’ Andy Dufresne is wrongly
          convicted of murdering his wife and incarcerated in Shawshank. Per its
          title, he eventually gets his redemption – but in the meantime, entire
          lives are lived, friendships forged, attitudes changed, leaving a
          constant trickle of hope amid the vast darkness. The sheer emotional
          release of it all has made it a perennial favourite, deftly
          constructed by Darabont’s masterful hands.

        <h3><b>Director:</b> <u>Christopher Nolan</u></h3>
        <h3>
          <b>Starring:</b>
          <u>
            Leonardo DiCaprio, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, Joseph

          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Talk about a true original. Christopher Nolan’s dreamy blockbuster
          takes layers of subconsciousness and turns them into action
          playgrounds, as a group of benevolent criminals set about planting the
          seed of an idea in the mind of a business magnate. Along with Tenet,
          this is the closest Nolan has come to making a Bond movie – just check
          out that snowy setpiece. While there’s plenty of braininess here (and
          a tantalising make-your-own-mind-up ending), there’s real brawn too:
          the climactic action sequence is so huge it takes up almost half the
          movie, and is actually three big action sequences temporally nested
          inside each other around a surreal, metaphysical-conflict core.
          Couldn’t be simpler, really.

        <p>
          A wizard is never late. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when
          he... well, you know the rest. Peter Jackson's game-changing fantasy
          epic was an astonishing achievement, akin to clambering up Mount-Doom
          itself – and while the entire trilogy stands far taller than its
          Hobbit protagonists, this first chapter is perhaps the most
          breathtaking of the three. The Fellowship Of The Ring contains so much
          movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to
          bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you've experienced
          regular film could possibly muster up. Come the conclusion, you're
          left feeling euphoric, bereft and hopeful, all at the same time.
